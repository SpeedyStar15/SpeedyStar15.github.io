A website containing a group of games that I made in Scratch and turbowrapped into html files.<br>
<br>
As of when I'm editing this (1/16/2026), there are only two games.<br>
<br>
The following is a list of the games that I've currently uploaded: <br>
  -Tag<br>
  -Meteor Blaster<br>
<br>
*hint: I recomment meteor blaster. It's super fun even though its still in progress (and to be honest tag is kinda bad).*
